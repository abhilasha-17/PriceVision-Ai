PrizeVision AI is a machine learning–powered price prediction system designed to estimate house/property prices based on multiple features such as area, location clusters, number of bedrooms, and other key factors.
It uses both regression and clustering techniques to deliver more structured and accurate predictions.

**Features:**

📊 Machine Learning Regression Model (trained with 93% test accuracy)
🧩 KMeans clustering for grouping similar locations
🔧 Data preprocessing pipeline with scaling + feature engineering
💾 Saved trained models (.pkl files) for instant prediction
📝 Jupyter Notebook for full EDA, training workflow, and evaluation
🖥️ Python app (app.py) that loads models and predicts prices
📈 Supports further scaling into APIs or web 

**Tech Stack:**

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
